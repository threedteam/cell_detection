There is the Microsoft COCO dataset of the cell detection project after data balancing in this directory, including 3 JSON annotations and 7000 BMP images, the images are divided into the train set "train", the validation set "validation", and the test set "test". In these subdirectories, the train set contains 6300 images, the validation set contains 700 images, and the test set contains 112 images.

The image file naming format is "category_sequence number in the category" for the original images, for intance, "carcinoma_in_situ_121", while "data augmentation method-category_sequence number in the category" for images generated by data augmentation, such as "feature_standardization-carcinoma_in_situ_121".

In the test set, 112 images are all from the original images, that is, 16 images are selected from each category.

The train set and validation set (a total of 7000 images) contain the remaining images in the original and 6195 new images obtained by data augmentation. To ensure data balance, we made the number of images 1000 for each category.

The details of images in each category are as follows:
(1)carcinoma in situ: 134 original images and 866 new images. 124 new images for every data augmentation method except the translation and the rotation, while 123 new images for the two methods.
(2)light dysplastic: 166 original images and 834 new images, including 120 new images generated by translation and 119 new images for other six methods.
(3)moderate dysplastic: 130 original images and 870 new images. 124 new images for every data augmentation method except the translation and the rotation, while 125 new images for the two methods.
(4)normal columnar: 82 original images and 918 new images. 98 new images for every data augmentation method except the translation and the rotation, while 214 new images for the two methods to ensure that there are a total of 1000 images in this category.
(5)normal intermediate: 54 original images and 946 new images. 70 new images for every data augmentation method except the translation and the rotation, while 298 new images for the two methods.
(6)normal superficiel: 58 original images and 942 new images. 74 new images for every data augmentation method except the translation and the rotation, while 286 new images for the two methods.
(7)severe dysplastic: 181 original images and 819 new images while 117 new images for every data augmentation method.

Introduction to JSON annotation field:
{
    "info": info,
    "licenses": [license],
    "images": [image],
    "annotations": [annotation],
    "categories": [category]
}
(1)The length of the "images" list is equal to the number of images in the data set, such as train set or validation set, and every element in the list is an instance of the image type.
(2)The length of the "annotations" list is equal to the number of images in the data set. Each image corresponds to a bounding box, and each bounding box corresponds to an element which is an instance of the annotation type,  
annotation{
    "id": int,
    "image_id": int,
    "category_id": int,
    "segmentation": [polygon],
    "area": float,
    "bbox": [x,y,width,height],
    "iscrowd": 0, # When the "iscrowd" field is 0, the corresponding "segmentation" field equals [polygon]
}
(3)The length of "categories" list is equal to the number of categories, which is 7 in this paper, that is, there are 7 categories of cells in total. Each element in "categories" list is an instance of category type.

The categories are as follows: carcinoma in situ, light dysplastic, moderate dysplastic, normal columnar, normal intermediate, normal superficiel, severe dysplastic.

The data augmentation methods are as follows: translation, rotation, scaling, feature standardization, zca whitening, vertical flip, horizontal flip.
